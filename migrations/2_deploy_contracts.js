/**
 * TRUFFLE MIGRATION SCRIPT - UPDATED FOR STREAMLINED CONTRACTS
 * 
 * This script deploys all 8 smart contracts to the blockchain
 * RESTRUCTURED: Contracts are now organized by exercise for better readability
 * 
 * MIGRATION PROCESS:
 * 1. Truffle compiles all contracts in contracts/ folder
 * 2. Migration script deploys them to specified network (Ganache)
 * 3. Each contract gets a permanent address on blockchain
 * 4. Address and ABI saved to build/contracts/ for frontend use
 * 
 * NEW STRUCTURE:
 * - Exercise3 contains GestionChaines
 * - Exercise7 contains Forme and Rectangle
 * - Exercise8 contains Payment
 * - Individual contracts for Exercises 1, 2, 4, 5, 6

/**
 * MIGRATION EXPLANATION:
 * 
 * 1. ARTIFACTS: artifacts.require() loads compiled contract
 * 2. DEPLOYER: deployer.deploy() deploys contract to blockchain
 * 3. CONSTRUCTOR PARAMS: Second+ parameters are constructor arguments
 * 4. NETWORK: Specified in truffle-config.js (development = Ganache)
 * 5. ACCOUNTS: Ganache provides test accounts with Ether
 * 6. GAS: Each deployment costs gas (paid by deployer account)
 * 
 * WHAT HAPPENS DURING DEPLOYMENT:
 * - Contract bytecode is sent to blockchain
 * - Constructor executes with provided parameters
 * - Contract gets permanent address
 * - ABI and address saved to build/contracts/
 * - Contract is ready for interaction
 * 
 * TRUFFLE COMMANDS:
 * - truffle compile: Compiles contracts
 * - truffle migrate: Runs migration scripts
 * - truffle migrate --reset: Redeploys all contracts
 * - truffle console: Interactive blockchain console
